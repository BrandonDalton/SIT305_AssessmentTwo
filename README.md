#Project Overview:

Brandon's Hardware Inventory Management  system is a proof of  concept application that  is intended  to be used within small businesses who need a simple and cheap way of managing inventory, taking  and saving images and displaying videos for  whatever purpose that they require. This project would be developed individually for different businesses depending on the needs that they require such as extra fields or a specific youtube  playlist. This project will be implemented on android devices only.

#Project Purpose:

My target is for users who manage or run small businesses or are in need of  a cheap inventory management system that can run on nearly any android phone making it a cheap purchase for a store without purchasing an expensive system. The best feature is the ability to easily handle a small inventory without the need for expensive software and equipment, perfect for small use cases and businesses
